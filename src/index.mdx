# Getting Started

Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable—reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

- **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s self-contained**. Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **It’s reusable**. You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
- **It’s accessible**. Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.

> We will use [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to make this integration possible.
> So you might face some issues if you use other react-native modules. 
> Usually, many react-native modules have a web alternative, make sure to alias them too.

# How to contribute
## How can I see the components?
Start by installing the dependencies of the project.
```bash
npm install
```

Once that is done, you should be able to run docz.
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will open docz at [this address](http://localhost:3000). Now you can edit components,
and as soon as you save, you should see the changes in the browser.

## How can I create a new component?
Each component should include at least 3 files. A starting point for the components can be copied 
from below. My suggestion would be to start by writting the documentation so that you can see 
the changes as you implement the component.

* **Component.tsx:** This file consists of the code for the component.

* **style.ts:** This file contains the styling for the component.

* **Component.mdx:** This file consists of the documentation for the component.

* **index.ts:** This file is used to export all the components in the Component directory.

* **Component-test.tsx:** This file contains the unit tests.



We have a custom script you can run to generate these files and populate it with boilerplate content:
```bash
Usage: generate [options] [command]

Options:
  -V, --version  output the version number
  -h, --help     output usage information

Commands:
  atom|a         Add an atom to the component library
  molecule|m     Add an molecule to the component library
  organism|o     Add an organism to the component library
  template|t     Add a template to the component library

npm run generate atom Button
```
