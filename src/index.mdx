# Getting Started

Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable—reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

- **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s self-contained**. Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **It’s reusable**. You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
- **It’s accessible**. Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.

> We will use [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to make this integration possible.
> So you might face some issues if you use other react-native modules. 
> Usually, many react-native modules have a web alternative, make sure to alias them too.

# How to contribute
## How can I see the components?
Start by installing the dependencies of the project.
```bash
npm install
```

Once that is done, you should be able to run docz.
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will open docz at [this address](http://localhost:3000). Now you can edit components,
and as soon as you save, you should see the changes in the browser.

## How can I create a new component?
Each component should include at least 3 files. A starting point for the components can be copied 
from below. My suggestion would be to start by writting the documentation so that you can see 
the changes as you implement the component.

#### Component.tsx
This file consists of the code for the component.
```tsx
import React from "react";

import { StyledView } from "./style"
import colors from "../../../theme/colors";

/** PROPS */
interface Props {
  /**  Example of an optional prop */
  optional?: string;
  /** Example of a required prop*/
  required: number;
}

/** Building the Component */
export const Component: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
  return (
    <StyledView>
        // TODO: implement the component
    </StyledView>
  );
};

/** Setting the defaults for the props*/
Button.defaultProps = {
  optional: "default",
};
```

#### style.ts
This file contains the styling for the component.
```tsx
import styled from "styled-components/native";

import colors from "../../../theme/colors";

/** PROPS */
interface Props {
}
/** 
 * Styled Components
 * 
 * Here you can add css to react native components to create a styled version of it
 */
const StyledView = styled.View`
    color: red;
`;
```

#### Component.mdx
This file consists of the documentation for the component.
```md
---
name: Component
menu: Atoms
---

import { Props, Playground } from "docz";
import { Component } from "./Component.tsx";

# Component

A description of the component

# Usage

<!-- ```tsx
import { Component } from "fixit-mobile-components";

// TODO: write how the component is used and uncomment this block
``` -->

## Props

<Props of={Component}></Props>

## Default

<Playground>
  <Component/>
</Playground>

```

#### index.ts
This file is used to export all the components in the Component directory.
```ts
import { Button } from "./Button";

export { Button };
```
